              Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a
              founding member of the Avengers.
            </p>,
            <p>
              As someone who was highly respected for his work regarding
              biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation, he was
              commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum
              which created Captain America, although Ross elected not to inform
              Banner what he was creating.
            </p>,
            <p>
              However, when an exposure to high levels of gamma radiation
              instead of vita radiation went awry, the mild-mannered scientist
              had found that when angered, provoked or excited, he would
              transform into the huge, rage-fueled, nearly mindless creature
              known as Hulk.

              Fearful of the damage that Hulk could inflict as well as fleeing
              from the United States government, Banner attempted to commit
              suicide; when the attempt failed, he chose to live a discreet life
              in South America while also communicating with Samuel Sterns to
              cure himself.

            <p>
              However, when General Ross had sent a team led by Emil Blonsky to
              apprehend Banner, he was then forced to return to New York City
              where he recruited the help of Betty Ross and Sterns to cure him
              of his affliction.

              Banner was apprehended by the Armed Forces shortly after, but
              Blonsky, who had received a variant of the Super Soldier Serum,
              was administered Banner's gamma-irradiated blood, transforming him
              into the Abomination and forcing Ross to allow Banner to turn into
              Hulk and battle him before then allowing Hulk to escape.

              Banner fled the United States and dedicated his time to aiding the
              sick and poor. When a mounting threat called for Banner's
              specialized scientific expertise, S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited him,
              knowing full well that the incredible strength of Banner's
              alter-ego, Hulk, would be an additional asset to the Avengers.
            </p>,
            <p>
              Banner was tasked with tracking down the Tesseract, working
              alongside Tony Stark to achieve this. Despite almost causing a
              disaster when he was forcibly transformed into Hulk by Loki,
              Banner joined the Avengers during the Battle of New York and
              assisted them in defeating Loki and his Chitauri army.

              Once the Avengers split up in the wake of the battle, Banner had

              Tower, free to live his life without apprehension.

              In order to make it so that Earth could always be safe without
              constantly needing the Avengers to protect it, Banner assisted
              Stark with creating Ultron, an artificial intelligence. Ultron,
              programmed to protect Earth at all costs, deemed humanity and the
              Avengers as its greatest threat and focused on annihilating them.

              Banner was then enlisted by Stark to help create Vision, and was

              Following Ultron's defeat, Hulk commandeered a Quinjet and left

              the Quinjet to crash on the planet Sakaar, where the stressful
              environment prevented him from regressing back into Banner,
              causing him to remain in Hulk form for two years.

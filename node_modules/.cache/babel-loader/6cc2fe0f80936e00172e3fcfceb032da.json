A fan of the\n              Captain, Coulson, was also part of this small team. The team\n              searched for two years to find Rogers' body. When they finally\n              found him, they defrosted him and then shipped his body to New\n              York City. When Rogers arrived in New York City, he was kept in a\n              simulated 1942 environment to try to ease him into what was\n              happening.\n            </p>,\n            <p>\n              When he awoke, he quickly realized it was not real and escaped\n              into the streets of a 2011 New York. In Times Square, Rogers\n              encountered Fury who told him that he's been \"asleep\" for nearly\n              seventy years. Rogers then realized that many of his old friends\n              were very likely dead, including his love interest, Peggy Carter.\n            </p>\n          ]}\n        />\n\n        <Section\n          bgImg={\n            screenWidth < 600 ? images.section4.small : images.section4.big\n          }\n          title={data.section4Title}\n          description={[\n            <p>\n              Loki stole the Tesseract from Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S., and\n              destroyed the base, killing eighty people during the process,\n              causing Nick Fury to revive the project.

He sought to find individuals\n              with incredible powers and abilities just like Danvers in hopes of\n              bringing them together as a team to fight as Earth's protectors.\n              The initiative was originally named \"The Protector Initiative\",\n              however, after Fury saw Danvers' call-sign from the time when she\n              was in the United States Air Force, he renamed it into the\n              Avengers Initiative.\n            </p>\n          ]}\n        />\n\n        <Section\n          bgImg={images.section2}\n          title={data.section2Title}\n          description={[\n            <p>\n              While S.H.I.E.L.D. was devoting a majority of its resources into\n              the building of the Triskelion, Nick Fury used finances to observe\n              individuals who possibly had superpowers, sending agents to\n              investigate these individuals and have them placed on the Index\n              for later encounters.\n            </p>,\n            <p>\n              In 2008, Phil Coulson and Melinda May discussed the initiative\n              enacted by Fury as they went to Manama, Bahrain to investigate Eva\n              Belyakov.
